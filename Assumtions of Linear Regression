Linear regression relies on a set of statistical assumptions about the data generating process.
Important nuance: some assumptions are required for unbiased estimates, others for valid inference (confidence intervals / p-values).

Here is the canonical list used in interviews and real modeling work.

✅ 1) Linearity

The relationship between predictors 
𝑋 X and outcome 
𝑦 y is linear in parameters.

This does not mean variables themselves must be linear; transformations (log, polynomial) are fine as long as coefficients enter linearly.

Violation looks like:

curved residual patterns

systematic under/over prediction

Fix:

feature engineering, splines, interactions, nonlinear models.

✅ 2) Independence of errors

Residuals should not be correlated with each other.

Common issue in:

time series

panel data

clustered observations

Violation leads to:

biased standard errors → wrong significance.

Detect:

Durbin–Watson, ACF plots.

Fix:

mixed models, GLS, cluster-robust SE, time-series models.

✅ 3) Homoscedasticity (constant variance)

Error variance should be constant across fitted values.

Violation:

funnel-shaped residuals.

Impact:

coefficients still unbiased, but SE and p-values unreliable.

Fix:

log transform

weighted least squares

robust standard errors.

✅ 4) No perfect multicollinearity

Predictors cannot be exact linear combinations of others.

Otherwise:

X not invertible → model cannot estimate.

Detect:

VIF, rank deficiency.

Fix:

drop or combine variables.

✅ 5) Exogeneity / Zero conditional mean

Errors must be unrelated to predictors.

E(ϵ∣X)=0

This is the most important assumption.

If violated → coefficients are biased.

Causes:

omitted variables

simultaneity

measurement error

selection bias

Fix:

instrumental variables, causal design, add controls.

✅ 6) Normality of errors (needed for inference)

Residuals should be normally distributed.

Important:

NOT required for unbiased coefficients.
Needed for accurate hypothesis tests in small samples.

With large N → CLT helps.
